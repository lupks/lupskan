# Lupskan | The Lupkoin Blockchain

## [Lupskan.com](https://lupskan.herokuapp.com)

<br>

Lupkoin is still underdevelopment. Testnet transactions can occur within the site and the blockchain can be viewed on [LUPSKAN](https://lupskan.herokuapp.com).

Feel free to [create a new wallet](https://lupkoin.herokuapp.com) on lupkoin and test out the coin. Any testnet users will be rewarded with mainnet coins as it goes live.
